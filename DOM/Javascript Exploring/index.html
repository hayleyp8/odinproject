    <span>“Don't you think that's a wonderful story?”</span>
    <p>Driven by her thirst for knowledge, Shiori Novella is "The Archiver."</p>
    <p>She turns her favorite stories and treasured memories into bookmarks and saves them.</p>
    <p>By misfortune, she was found to have obtained forbidden knowledge within one of her stories and was imprisoned.
        But to her, that experience itself is but a fascinating story. In order to continue her search for more stories,
        she planned and executed a prison break.</p>
